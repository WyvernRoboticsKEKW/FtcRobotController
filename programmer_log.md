Today James and I reviewed with Josh what he learned the previous day.
After I was satisfied, I worked on setting setting up Git on the laptop we had.
While James was giving Josh example code segments and having him do practice exercises,
I was cloning the code repository I had set up on [GitHub](https://github.com/samheiden/SkyStone-Wyverns12889/).
I added and commited the old code from last year to look at as samples,
and updated the SDK to version 5.2.
After I had done this, showed some of last year's code to Josh and James.

Today I explained my concept for driving with Mecanum wheels to Thomas, and 
coding and commiting a basic configuration file and my concept for 
Mecanum drive.
My concept involves an axis rotation in order to convert the axis from an x-y axis
to the diagonal axis required by mechanum wheels.
