## The Logge

### Week 1

### Week 2
#### Monday 2019.09.16
We finalized the positions of everyone on the team.
We got a new programmer, Josh.
So today we went over basic programming and Java concepts with him.

James and I reviewed with Josh what he learned the previous day.
After I was satisfied, I worked on setting setting up Git on the laptop we had.
While James was giving Josh example code segments and having him do practice exercises,
I was cloning the code repository I had set up on [GitHub](https://github.com/samheiden/SkyStone-Wyverns12889/).
I added and commited the old code from last year to look at as samples,
and updated the SDK to version 5.2.
After I had done this, showed some of last year's code to Josh and James.

I explained my concept for driving with Mecanum wheels to Thomas, and 
coding and commiting a basic configuration file and my concept for 
Mecanum drive.
My concept involves an axis rotation in order to convert the axis from an x-y axis
to the diagonal axis required by mechanum wheels.

We went over the code we wrote yesterday with the rest of the team, and
we taught Josh some basic JS, including variables and for loops. Afterwards, to test his knowledge, we had him try and create a program that prints out a multiplication table.
--Thomas

I talked to Foushee on the Dragons about the code I made yesterday.
He seemed to think it was good, although we would need to test it once we received the Mecanum wheels.
--Sam

### Week 3
#### Monday 2019.09.23
We created a series of functions in JS in order to get Josh used to using prebuilt functions.
I had Josh move and transform a box on the screen.
--James 
#### Thursday 2019.09.26
We spent the day downloading a virtual robot simulator and its dependencies to test and improve our program while the robot is being constructed. We werenâ€™t able to test if it functioned well because we spent too much time searching for the dependencies.  
--Josh
#### Friday 2019.09.27
After returning to the computer, we continued to try and get the robot virtualizer to work. While Sam was working on this, James was teaching me some Calculus concepts and testing me on my knowledge of computer hardware. After about an hour and a half, Sam had finally got the robot virtualizer working, and we were able to test out the mecanum drive code. The code seemed to be working, but we had a few ideas to improve on it and we noticed some small issues with the code.
--Thomas

### Week 4
#### Monday 2019.09.30
 We changed our mecanum drive code to account for more scenarios and then we began installing arch linux onto the computer we would be using.
